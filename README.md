# My Resume

This LaTeX resume template was originally created by [Jitin](https://github.com/jitinnair1/autoCV). I've forked this repository to customize and update my resume.


## Site

The latest version of my resume is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://username.github.io/repo-name/).


## Quickstart

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Go to the [original GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ragulprince).
2. Click on the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Modify the `cv.tex` File
1. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Open the `cv.tex` file.
3. Edit the file to update your personal information, skills, experience, etc.
4. Save the changes.

### Step 3: Push Changes to Your Repository
1. Commit the changes by clicking on the "Commit changes" button.
2. Push the changes to your forked repository.

### Step 4: Compile the LaTeX CV
1. After pushing the changes, a GitHub Actions workflow will automatically compile the LaTeX `cv.tex` file into a PDF.
2. The compiled PDF will be available under the `build` branch of your repository.

### Step 5: Set Up GitHub Pages
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Under "Source", select `build` from the dropdown menu.
5. Click "Save".

### Step 6: Access Your CV
1. Once the GitHub Pages is set up, your CV will be accessible at: `https://username.github.io/repo-name/`
   - Replace `username` with your GitHub username.
   - Replace `repo-name` with the name of your forked repository.

### Step 7: Get a Direct Link to the PDF
1. The direct link to the generated PDF will always point to the latest version of your CV.
2. You can use this link on your website, LinkedIn, etc.
